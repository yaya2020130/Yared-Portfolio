# Yared-Portfolio


##  Responsively Designed Portfolio


A personal portfolio website with an about page, a contact page, and a projects page.

In the future, I plan to update this website with project links on the "portfolio" page. I also plan on making the contact form functional; currently, it is not.

## Usage/Installation
To view the website, follow the link on the repository page; otherwise, you can click here.

In order to see the mobile responsiveness of the site, you have a couple options:

Resize your browser window.
View on your mobile device.
Use Google Chrome's DevTools by right-clicking and selecting "inspect." From there, you can toggle the device toolbar and then switch the view to different devices.
To edit the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as VS Code. z
